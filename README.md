# TIC-TAC-TOE
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking spaces in the grid with their respective symbols, usually 'X' and 'O', with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
#Here's a brief overview of how the game works:
#PLAYER VS PLAYER

    Setup: The game is played on a 3x3 grid. One player is assigned 'X', and the other is assigned 'O'.

    Gameplay: The players take turns placing their symbol on an empty space in the grid. Once a symbol is placed, it cannot be moved.

    Winning: A player wins the game if they have three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. The game ends immediately when a player achieves this.

    Draw: If all spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
#PLAYER VS COMPUTER

    Setup: The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid. The player is typically assigned the symbol 'X', while the computer takes the symbol 'O'.

    Gameplay:
        The player takes the first turn, making a move by selecting an empty cell in the grid to place their 'X'.
        After the player's move, the computer AI analyzes the current state of the board and decides its move.
        The computer's move is determined by its AI algorithm, which aims to make the best possible move to either win the game or block the player from winning.
        This process of player move followed by computer move continues until the game reaches a conclusion.

    Winning or Drawing:
        The game continues until one of the following outcomes is reached:
            The player wins by getting three of their symbols ('X') in a row, column, or diagonal.
            The computer wins by getting three of its symbols ('O') in a row, column, or diagonal.
            The game ends in a draw if all cells in the grid are filled, and neither the player nor the computer has achieved a winning configuration.

    Game Flow:
        The game loop continues until one of the winning or drawing conditions is met.
        After each move by the player or the computer, the game state is updated and displayed to the player.

    Difficulty Levels:
        Some implementations may offer different difficulty levels for the computer opponent, ranging from easy to hard.
        In easier modes, the computer AI may make random moves or follow simpler strategies, while in harder modes, it may employ more sophisticated algorithms to challenge the player.
    Game Flow: The game continues until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
